Project Two (CS400 @ UW Madison) - Dictionary Reader Project
============================================================

Description:

This project creates a Dictionary Reader tool through the implementation of a Red Black Tree data structure. This data structure allows the user to interact 
with the dictionary through functions such as searching for a word and definitions, finding words in the dictionary starting with a certain letter, adding a word to
the dictionary, and finding the size of the dictionary.

*Note: This project was in collaboration with 3 other CS400 students besides the owner of this repository.
