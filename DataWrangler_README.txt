Files Written by Me:
--------------------
<List all files that were within this project that were written by you, and
 include a short description of the purpose that each file servers>

WordInterface.java : This class is an interface for word objects
Word.java : This class writes the code for methods in WordInterface and can create a word object
DictionaryReaderInterface.java : This class is an interface for DictionaryReader objects to read a file in
DictionaryReader.java : This class writes the code for the method in DictionaryReaderInterface to parse through the data in a file
TestDictionaryReaderAndWord.java : This class tests DictionaryReader and Word and sees if the methods work as they should
TestDictionary.txt : This is a dummy text file to see how the classes I wrote work on a file instead of just a hardcoded string.
dictionary.txt : This is the official text file that our group project is being run on and I created it with a bunch of words and their respective definitions
RedBlackTree.java : This the basic RedBlackTree data structure I wrote in week 7 and we are using it as the RBT in our project
